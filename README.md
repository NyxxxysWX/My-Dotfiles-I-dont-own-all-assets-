If you guys want to share this to other platforms or use it in a collection of some sort please email me at masonnohl@gmail.com I will likley say yes. (even if im inactive I still check my email.)

Also reach out to the creator of the chezmoi dotfiles. I had no part in making them and I will not take any credit for them whatsoever.
